# Organization
All about organising this place, infos on its purpose, etc.

### Credits
The idea for this repo/organization was born in a thread in Visguy's Forum: http://visguy.com/vgforum/index.php?topic=9734.0

## Justification
Whilst Visguy's forum is THE greatest Visio related forum, it lacks the possibility to organize content. Keeping this idea in mind, this repo is in no means meant to replace the forum. Much more is it meant to collect the "wisdom" of the forum in a more concise manner.

### Warning
I am an absolute newbie with the Git system in general and GitHub in particular, trying to set up a community collaborative platform.
Bear with me.

## Todos
1. upload some stuff I find useful
2. invite viguy's core users
3. make the adjustments necessary for usefull use (down and uploads, messages, ... ?)

99. hand the project to a young enthousiastic "Visioneer".
